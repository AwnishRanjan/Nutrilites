# Nutrilites Project

## Overview

Nutrilites is an application developed for General daily life usecase to make you eat healthy food . It incorporates Docker for containerization, machine learning using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for unsupervised training, and integration with the Gemini API for creating this amazing application.

## Features

- **Containerization with Docker:** Docker is utilized to create an isolated environment for running the Nutrilites application, ensuring consistency across different platforms.

- **Machine Learning with KNN:** K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is employed for unsupervised training. This allows the Nutrilites application to suggest the personalize diet plan according to the habbits of user . 

- **Integration with Gemini API:** Nutrilites integrates with the Gemini API to use to get the details for food images and then we can use our ML model to provide you proper diet and healthy food details.

## Usage

 it is used in daily lide nutrition suggestion and check the meal that provide you what are the nutritions present in that with all the data and representation 
 it will suggest you diet plan accourding to you needs and habbits .
